# Task 5 â€“ Decision Trees & Random Forests

### Objective
To learn tree-based models (Decision Tree & Random Forest) for classification using the Heart Disease dataset.

### Steps
1. Trained Decision Tree and visualized it.
2. Analyzed overfitting by adjusting tree depth.
3. Trained a Random Forest and compared accuracies.
4. Interpreted feature importances.
5. Evaluated both models using cross-validation.

### Tools Used
- Python (Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy)

### Result
- Random Forest outperformed the Decision Tree with better test accuracy and lower variance.
